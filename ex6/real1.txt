OMG Are you crazy!! How much money did you just put on there! Waay to generous sweety.
Still not sure when I am going to be able to get up there but hope it is soon. 

Did you have a nice time at Pepper's? 

Is Chloe better? I got her cold too. :-D Think I was run down from recovering from that 4week cough I had after my other cold and by the Sat after you left I was snotty and sick. I slept all day Sat and cancelled my hike on Sunday and I was ok for work by Monday (though looked like Rudolph). I took a bunch of minerals (zinc vit c, Iron and B group) and I got better reasonably quick.
The last week there was gastro going around all the schools and childcare centres so probably good that you were not down here last week (imagine the flight home if she got that at the park instead of a cold!!). Lots of Mum's at my work have it so I'm avoiding them and hitting the hand sanitiser pretty hard ...Just in case. :-D

Have you done any more networking for the types of role you want to do in IT liaising?

Ok.. I think we are finally there. My identity has been verified and my Global Wallet has been activated.
Global Wallet : 0010-1076064910

Is that all you need or do you need the direct load or BPay load details?

Hugs,

No drama.
I've not got the global wallet card thingy yet. Just the Velocity account. :-)

We have QLD weather at the moment. 35`C and hugs crazy downpours. Clipsal Race was cut short due to all the water, Fringe Garden of Unearthly Delights got washed out and the generators to multiple venues blew with all the water. Lots of events cancelled and refunded. Went to a show last night with some friends and 2 out of 4 were drenched through and covered in mud. But it was ok ...we were seeing a play which is set in WWI and all the audience sits inside a replica WWI Bunker with the actors - wooden bench seats, a dirt floor, snoke filled, with lanterns etc. Being wet and muddy just added to the ambiance of the show. :-D

Hugs.

Heya ‚Äì sorry to make sending your present a pain! Attached is a screenshot of the global wallet site ‚Äì once you get the visa debit card and activate it (along with annoying security questions), then at the top of the tab, just underneath the ‚Äòavailable balance‚Äô is the ‚ÄúGlobal Wallet Account Number‚Äù i.e. mine is 0010-1066‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs the number you need to send me so I can transfer :)
